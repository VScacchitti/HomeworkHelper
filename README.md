#Description: Online platform to keep track of assignments. This application also assists students with their homework in the form of a calculator, grammar bot, and spell checker. We’ve added a place for artwork as well!

##Motivation: Due to Covid-19, students have had to switch to remote online learning. We’ve heard from friends and family that this switch to online learning has been difficult for some kids. We were inspired by the old school Trapper Keepers and decided to create an electronic version.

#User story:
